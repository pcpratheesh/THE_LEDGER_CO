# THE_LEDGER_CO


## The challenge

[Click Here to view the challenge](https://www.geektrust.in/coding-problem/backend/ledger-co)

You work at a startup called The Ledger Co., a marketplace for banks to lend money to borrowers and receive payments for the loans.

The interest for the loan is calculated by I = P*N*R where P is the principal amount, N is the number of years and R is the rate of interest. The total amount to repay will be A = P + I

The amount should be paid back monthly in the form of EMIs. The borrowers can also pay a lump sum (that is, an amount more than their monthly EMI). In such a case, the lump sum will be deducted from the total amount (A) which can reduce the number of EMIs. This doesnâ€™t affect the EMI amount unless the remaining total amount is less than the EMI. All transactions happen through The Ledger Co.

You need to design a system to find out how much amount a user has paid the bank and how many EMIs are remaining .


### Database configuration
You can change db connection details in .env file

Domine : valid config value mysql, sqlite

## EMI
Emi has been calculated by simple interest rate
**SI = P * R * T/100**

SI	Simple Interest
R	Rate of interest
T	Time
P	Principal Amount


The formula for calculating EMI using interest rate is:

**EMI = (Principal + Interest)/Period in Months**


## Execution

./main LOAN IDIDI bank 1000 1 2

./main PAYMENT IDIDI bank 1000 5

./main BALANCE IDIDI bank 0



## Assumptions and conditions added with Commands

### Balance
- It prints the total amount paid by the borrower, including all the Lump Sum amounts paid including that EMI number, and the no of EMIs remaining.
- Only print Active emi payments
  
  for example : 
    
    If IDIDI have **12** month emi payment with **85** as EMI amount. He have 12 active EMIs. On 1st payment he pays **170**. He payed **85** more as lumpsum. 
    Thus the extra paid **85** has been deducted from last emi and that EMI will be marked as fully paid.

    So that the user have 10 active emi's remain to pay


### Payment
- EMIS can paid only one by one
- Can't pay 4th emi without 3rd emi payment
- Checking the emi already paid for a particular month
- Payment Amount should be greaterthan or equals to the EMI monthly amount
- If pay more than loan amount, remaining balance amount should be credit back to the user


### Loan
- Can't request multiple loan with the same bank and borrower name without completing all the emi payments.
